# Registered Virtual File Drivers (VFDs)

Members of the HDF5 users community can register VFDs for use with HDF5. To register a VFD please contact [The HDF Helpdesk](https://help.hdfgroup.org) with the following information: 

* Contact information for the developer requesting a new identifier
* Short description of the new VFD
* Links to any relevant information including licensing information 

Here is the current policy regarding VFD identifier assignment: Valid VFD identifiers can have values from 0 through 255 for VFDs defined by the HDF5 library. Values 256 through 511 are available for testing new VFDs.  Subsequent values should be obtained by contacting the The HDF Help Desk.

Please contact the maintainer of a VFD for help implementing the plugin.
