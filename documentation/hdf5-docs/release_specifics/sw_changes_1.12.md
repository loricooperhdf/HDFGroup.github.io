# Software Changes from Release to Release in HDF5 1.12

For a description of the major new features that were introduced, please see [New Features in HDF5 Release 1.12](sw_changes_1.12.md).

This page provides information on the changes that a maintenance developer needs to be aware of between successive releases of HDF5, such as:

* New or changed features or tools
* Syntax and behavioral changes in the existing application programming interface (the API)
* Certain types of changes in configuration or build processes

Note that bug fixes and performance enhancements in the C library are automatically picked up by the C++, Fortran, and Java libraries.

The following information is included below.

* <a href="#2versus1">Release 1.12.2 versus Release 1.12.1</a>
* <a href="#1versus0">Release 1.12.1 versus Release 1.12.0</a>
* <a href="#1versus0">Release 1.12.0 versus Release 1.10.6</a>

The release notes also list changes made to the library, but these notes tend to be more at a more detail-oriented level. The release notes may include new features, bugs fixed, supported configuration features, platforms on which the library has been tested, and known problems. The release note files are listed below and can be found at the top level of the HDF5 source code tree in the release_docs directory.
