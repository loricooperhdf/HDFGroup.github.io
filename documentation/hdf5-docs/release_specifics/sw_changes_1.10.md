# Software Changes from Release to Release in HDF5 1.10

For a description of the major new features that were introduced, please see New Features in HDF5 Release 1.10.)

This page provides information on the changes that a maintenance developer needs to be aware of between successive releases of HDF5, such as:

* New or changed features or tools
* Syntax and behavioral changes in the existing application programming interface (API)
* Certain types of changes in configuration or build processes

Note that bug fixes and performance enhancements in the C library are automatically picked up by the C++, Fortran, and Java libraries.

The following information is included below.

<h2 id="compatiblity">Compatiblity and Performance Issues</h2>

Not all HDF5-1.10 releases are compatible. Users should NOT be using 1.10 releases prior to HDF5-1.10.3. See the compatibility matrix below for details on compatibility between 1.10 releases:

| Release  | 1.10.5+ | 1.10.4 | 1.10.3 | 1.10.2 | 1.10.1 | 1.10.0-patch1 | 1.10.0 |

The release notes also list changes made to the library, but these notes tend to be more at a more detail-oriented level. The release notes may include new features, bugs fixed, supported configuration features, platforms on which the library has been tested, and known problems. The release note files are listed below and can be found at the top level of the HDF5 source code tree in the release\_docs directory.

### Compatibility Report

See the [API compatibility report between 1.10.1 and 1.10.0-patch1]() for details.

<h2 id="0versus8_16">Release 1.10.0 versus Release 1.8.16</h2>

This section lists interface-level changes and other user-visible changes in behavior in the transition from HDF5 Release 1.8.16 to Release 1.10.0.

Changed Type
hid\_t

Changed from a 32-bit to a 64-bit value.

hid\_t is the type is used for all HDF5 identifiers. This change, which is necessary to accomodate the capacities of modern computing systems, therefore affects all HDF5 applications. If an application has been using HDF5's hid\_t the type, recompilation will normally be sufficient to take advantage of HDF5 Release 1.10.0. If an application uses an integer type instead of HDF5's hid\_t type, those identifiers must be changed to a 64-bit type when the application is ported to the 1.10.x series.

New Features and Feature Sets
Several new features are introduced in HDF5 Release 1.10.0.

#### Single-Writer / Multiple-Reader or SWMR

#### Collective Metadata I/O

#### Fine-tuning the metadata cache

#### File Space Management

#### Virtual Datasets or VDS

#### Partial Edge Chunk Options

#### Relative Pathnames for External Links

#### Property List Encoding and Decoding

More substantial lists follow, including new and modified C functions and Fortran subroutines.

New Features, including associated C Functions and Fortran Wrappers
The following features are described and documented in New Features in HDF5 Release 1.10.0. On this page, we list each feature and its associated C functions and Fortran wrappers.

H5Fstart\_swmr\_write

Enables SWMR writing mode for a file.

### Compatibility Report and Comments

[Compatibility report for Release 1.10.0 versus Release 1.8.16]()

Comments regarding the report

In the C interface, the hid\_t change from 32-bit to 64-bit was made in order to address a performance problem that arose when the library "ran out" of valid object identifiers to issue and thus needed to employ an expensive algorithm to find previously issued identifiers that could be re-issued. This problem is avoided by switching the size of the hid\_t type to 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers in order to make the pool of available integers significantly larger. (H5E\_major\_t and H5E\_minor\_t are aliased to hid\_t which is why they changed size as well). (An alternate solution to this problem was applied in release HDF5 1.8.5 but this is the cleaner/preferred solution and had to wait until 1.10.0 to be included).

hbool\_t will now be defined as a \_Bool type when configure determines that it's available.

Public structs that have members of type hid\_t or hbool\_t are affected by the above changes accordingly.

The H5Fget\_info function was renamed due to the introduction of a newer version of the function which returns additional information. The H5Rdereference function was renamed due to the introduction of a newer version of the function which allows a data access property list to be passed in. Both changes are accompanied with compatibility macros, so while existing code will need to be recompiled in order to use the newer library version, these functions do not need to be changed in application code using them provided that the HDF5 API compatibility macros are configured appropriately.
